// the patterns are explained at the bottom of the file

// colour is a hex representation in the format 0x<R><G><B> e.g. 0x000000 is black 0xFF0000 is red .....

// the directory is the path relative to the images directory
// in the directory (e.g. Cube1) the script expects the cube faces named back.jpg, bottom.jpg, front.jpg, left.jpg, right.jpg and top.jpg
// in a size like 512x512, 1024x1024 or 2048x2048

// I usually use PTGui to make this conversion - this allows to set the size and jpg compression - smaller files load quicker BUT you might get compression artifacts

// This conversion could be implemented in javascript as well but it would need to run every time again
// Doinig it in javascript means it would use the device for the conversion which might take some time so I decided NOT to do the conversion
// in the script but require the cube faces as input

// there are also free online services you can use to convert an equirectangular image to cube faces like
//
// https://jaxry.github.io/panorama-to-cubemap/
// 
// and free tools for download
// https://pragmar.com/qbit/

// please create the cube faces so that they are sized to a power of 2 e.g. 1024x1024 or 2048x2048
// this will prevent the script from complaining (warnings) that the texture is not a power of 2
